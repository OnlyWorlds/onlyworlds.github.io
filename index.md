**OnlyWorlds** is an open data [language](/docs/specification/) for worldbuilding. It defines 22 element categories with structured fields and relationships, for worlds that are portable across environments and computationally flexible.

You are invited to build or migrate [worlds](https://onlyworlds.com/worlds) using free [tools](/docs/tools/) or to [develop](/docs/development/) your own. Take an [interactive introduction](https://ecosystem-explorer.onlyworlds.com)   (best on desktop) or [get started](/docs/getting-started/) creating an account and world. Your [feedback](/docs/contact/) is instrumental to improving the langauge and tooling.

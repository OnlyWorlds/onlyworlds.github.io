  **OnlyWorlds** is an open data [language](/docs/specification/) for worldbuilding. It defines element [categories](/docs/specification/) with structured fields and relationships, for worlds that are portable across environments and computationally flexible.

Build or migrate [worlds](https://onlyworlds.com/worlds) using [provided tools](/docs/tools/) or consult [development resources](/docs/development/) to create your own. 

Your [feedback](/docs/contact/) is instrumental to improving the langauge and infrastructure.

Take an [interactive introduction](https://explorer.onlyworlds.com) (best on desktop) or [get started](/docs/getting-started/) with your first world and migration.

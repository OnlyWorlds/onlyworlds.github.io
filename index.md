**OnlyWorlds** is a universal language for digital worlds. It offers a **standardized** way to represent characters, locations,  creatures, events, and anything else that might inhabit or define fictional or historic settings.  

## OnlyWorlds includes

[**A common language**](https://github.com/OnlyWorlds/OnlyWorlds/tree/main/schema) of element categories and fields that capture the full complexity of any world. They are defined in a readable YAML schema that translates effectively into other programming languages.

[**A website**](https://onlyworlds.com) that offers free world hosting and management. Worlds are represented in text and easily exported for local storage and offline use.  

[**A world transfer system**](https://www.onlyworlds.com/api/docs) with custom authentication and an OpenAPI specification for easy export, edit and import of worlds.

[**A set of free tools**](/docs/tool-directory/) for building and visualizing worlds.  

[**Integration guides and tools**](/docs/getting-started/migration-guide/) for rapidly converting existing work into the OnlyWorlds format.  

[**Developer support**](/docs/developer-support/) for developers of any experience level to get started building tools that they want to use or sell. 

[**Infrastructure and AI tools**](https://github.com/OnlyWorlds/OnlyWorlds) to further enable and simplify this development. 

[**Feedback channels**](https://github.com/OnlyWorlds/OnlyWorlds/discussions) for a framework that is intended to evolve significantly over time.

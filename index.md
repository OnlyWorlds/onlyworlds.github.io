# Welcome to OnlyWorlds

OnlyWorlds is a world-building framework that enables the creation, sharing and simulation of worlds across a wide range of tools and applications.

It provides infrastructure and support for a community-defined, uniform data structure that approaches worlds as game-development-ready files. 

## Introduction

Creators have a wide range of tools at their disposal, from pen-and-paper to note-taking apps and specialized software, whether they're building worlds for storytelling, game design, tabletop campaigns or just for fun.

Some tools allow total flexibility in defining elements, while others impose more structured templates (**character** or **person**? **place** or **location**? **item** or **object**?). Custom templates can be a middle ground, where users can apply their own organizational rules and potentially share them with others.
 
OnlyWorlds pushes the concept of a pre-defined-schema to the very extreme of the spectrum: it proposes a breakdown of every conceivable part of your world into a **one-size-fits-all**, uniform data format.

OnlyWorlds takes the structured approach to the extreme, offering a unified data format that breaks down every aspect of a world in a consistent way. This format is designed to be flexible enough for a wide range of ideas while maintaining the structure needed for digital tools to interpret and interact with the data.

You can create stories in your preferred writing app, place elements using a map tool, and then easily upload and display your world on a website. OnlyWorlds ensures that these processes integrate smoothly, allowing content to move between tools and supporting developers in building compatible tools where possible.

The underlying data structures are built with a game development mindset, ensuring that worlds created in OnlyWorlds can be integrated into games and simulations. After years of refinement, the framework is now in a stage where community feedback will help drive its evolution.
 

## Philosophy

- **Design for Flexibility**: Support the widest range of worlds and functionality
- **Free and Open Source**: Refine and enhance through community input and feedback
- **Ecosystem of Integration**: Foster open development with no commercial restrictions

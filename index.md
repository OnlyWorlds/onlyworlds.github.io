## Welcome to OnlyWorlds

OnlyWorlds is a world-building framework that enables the creation, sharing, and simulation of worlds across wide ranges of tools and applications. 

By defining worlds in a uniform data format, OnlyWorlds enables world transfer across different platforms, without being confined to specific applications or websites.

### Philosophy
- **Design for Flexibility**: Support the widest range of worlds and content
- **Free and Open Source**: Continuously refine and enhance through community input and feedback
- **Ecosystem of Integration**: Foster open development with no commercial restrictions

### Approach

The leading challenge that OnlyWorlds faces is to define data models that represents various parts of the world. These parts (elements) with specific definitions (attributes) need to support all the abstractions that we like to create: societies, stories, war, economies, power dynamics.  

Over many iterations of world creation with game development consideration, with a special interest in history and simulation, OnlyWorlds now provides a complete draft proposal that will require indefinite refinement and improvement.
 

### Getting Started
1. **Explore:** Read more about the [framework](/docs/framework/) and the element [categories](/docs/framework/categories) that define it
2. **Try:** Take a look at current [state and updates](/docs/updates), and try your worlds with the free [tools](/docs/tools) that are available
3. **Contribute:** Join [Discord](https://discord.gg/twCjqvVBwb) and [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/OnlyWorlds/OnlyWorlds/discussions), or participate in active [development](/docs/development/)

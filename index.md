# OnlyWorlds

OnlyWorlds is a lightweight, text-based standard for defining digital worlds that enables data portability across applications. 
Worlds defined this way can be collaboratively developed and brought to life through writing tools, mapping software, game engines, and any other compatible applications.

## The Problem

World-building spans everything from notebooks and wikis to specialized software, but the underlying data often gets locked in limited ecosystems.
There are many ways you might want to digitally engage with your world data, but no common pathways between them. 


## The Solution

OnlyWorlds provides a structured, text-based standard that enables interoperability between world-building tools.
By defining a common language for characters, locations, items, and other world elements, world data becomes freely transferable. 
Write your history in one app, visualize locations in another, and simulate its economy in a third, all working on the same consistent world definition.
The standard prioritizes flexibility, open-source development, and unrestricted tool integration: for storytellers, tabletop gamers, game developers, and anyone that wants to build worlds and help develop the framework. 

## Origins

OnlyWorlds is developed as a free and open-source standard, rooted in years of research and experimentation. Its data design draws from work that includes exploring political power modeling (see ["Power Scheming" Thesis](link-to-thesis-if-available)) and practical applications like this [reconstruction and simulation of ancient Sicily](https://www.onlyworlds.com/static/webgl/index.html) that was hosted on an [earlier iteration](https://github.com/worldsmithdev/Worldsmith) of an open source world building platform.

## Intent

Its current data definitions follow from such earlier work, and should be seen as starting points intended to evolve based on community feedback and collaboration. Suggestions for improving categories, fields, relationships, or the overall structure are actively encouraged through channels like [Discord](https://discord.gg/twCjqvVBwb) and [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/OnlyWorlds/OnlyWorlds/discussions). 

## Infrastructure

Developers of all kinds and levels are encouraged to integrate its definitions into their new or existing tools. Language conversions and contribution support are available on the [OnlyWorlds GitHub repository](https://github.com/OnlyWorlds/OnlyWorlds), and the [API specification](https://onlyworlds.com/api/docs) offers easy interfacing with people's worlds through an open server.

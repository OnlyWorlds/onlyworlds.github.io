OnlyWorlds is a text based, open source standard for defining digital worlds. It enables data portability across applications for writing, organizing, mapping, showcasing, simulating and gamifying worlds. 

With this data structure comes [infrastructure](https://github.com/OnlyWorlds/OnlyWorlds) and [tooling](../docs/tool-directory/) for builders and developers. Clear [API docs](https://onlyworlds.com/api/docs) and [world management](https://www.onlyworlds.com) place your world in an ecosystem with endless possibilities.

Go to [Getting Started](../docs/getting-started/) for first steps or [Specification](../docs/specification/) for framework details.

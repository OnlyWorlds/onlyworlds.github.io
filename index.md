## Welcome to OnlyWorlds

OnlyWorlds is a world-building framework that enables the creation, sharing, and simulation of worlds across wide ranges of tools and applications. 

### Overview

Consider how a game developer might integrate your world into game logic for games of various types: narrative, exploration, strategy, simulation 

Locations and characters woudl be usable data points. But is it item or object, and country or state or nation or organization? And how might a farm's output be measured? 

OnlyWorlds provides a game-ready fit for your worlds, for game logic and simulation capabilities

Any world broken down into elements that are categorized, fielded, linked, typed, and comprehensive

To find an imperfect but optimum balance between ease-of-building-into and data-usefulness

Worlds are now files that can be loaded into any types of digital applications

Any existing world from popular media or your own archives can be disected and reconfigured into all kinds of wonders
  

### Philosophy
- **Design for Flexibility**: Support the widest range of worlds and operations
- **Free and Open Source**: Refine and enhance through community input and feedback
- **Ecosystem of Integration**: Foster open development with no commercial restrictions

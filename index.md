# Welcome to OnlyWorlds

OnlyWorlds is a world building framework that enables world creation, sharing, and simulation across an endless range of tools and applications.

By proposing and maintaining one uniform data structure, your worlds become 'files' that are no longer contained within single applications or websites.

Use your preferred writing application to create a world's content; palce its elements on your maps with a specialized mapping tool; share and collaborate using dedicated websites; integrate your worlds in games, simulation, or exploration software to bring them to life.

 
## Philosophy
- Designed for flexibility to support the most expansive range of worlds and content
- Free and open source, continually refined and enhanced with community input and feedback
- Encourage developers to contribute and incorporate, with no commercial restrictions on tool and application development


## Getting Started
1. **Explore:** Read more about the [framework](/docs/framework/) and the element [categories](/docs/framework/categories) that define it
2. **Try:** Take a look at current [state and updates](/docs/updates), and start building with the free [tools](/docs/tools) that are currently available
3. **Contribute:** Join [discussions](https://github.com/OnlyWorlds/OnlyWorlds/discussions) for changes that you would like to make, or join active work on [development](/docs/development/)

**OnlyWorlds** is an open standard for worldbuilding. It structures worlds into 22 element types (characters, locations, and more) with fields and relationships that make them portable, connected, and usable by any type of application.

Create worlds at [onlyworlds.com](https://onlyworlds.com/worlds), use them with [free tools](/docs/tools), or create your own solutions with the open [API](/docs/development/api-reference), [SDKs](/docs/development/packages), and [AI solutions](/docs/development/ai).
 
 
[Get started](/docs/getting-started) building or developing, watch the [welcome video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XBeNjUoTgc) for a two-minute overview, or    take an [interactive introduction](https://explorer.onlyworlds.com).

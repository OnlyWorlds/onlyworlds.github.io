## Welcome to OnlyWorlds

OnlyWorlds is a world-building framework that enables the creation, sharing, gamification and simulation of worlds across wide ranges of tools and applications. 

## Overview

There is no **correct** appraoch to the mediums and methods of creating and organizing worlds. Between pen-and-paper, general note-taking software, and dedicated world building applications, there is a wide range of solutions that a world builder can choose to support their creative habits.

Some of these solutions will offer complete freedom in how a user breaks down their worlds into elements: **character** or **person**, **place** or **location**, **item** or **object**. Other applications might force the user into a schema down to various levels of detail. Custom templates can be a middle ground that allows the user to impose schematic rules on their own projects, and perhaps share them with others. 

OnlyWorlds pushes the concept of a pre-defined-schema to the very extreme of the spectrum: it proposes a breakdown of every conceivable part of your world into a **one-size-fits-all**, uniform data format.

It's a great challenge to force users into a structure that is 1. flexible enough to support the wide range of ideas and concepts but 2. does not constrict or limit the creative process. But there is a massive reward to it: digital applications of all kinds can anticipate this structure and **operate** any world that fits it.

You might create content and stories in a favorite **writing** app; localize these elements in a dedicated **map-placement** tool; then upload the result to a website that effectively **displays** the world to others.

The data structures of OnlyWorlds are rooted in a **game development** perspective, so that a wide range of games (and simulation software) can effectively hook into worlds and make them come alive. 

Creating a structure with the right balance between flexibility and operability is an iterative process that has taken the author several years to lay the foundations for. It is now entering a stage of user validation, refinement and rework. 
 

## Philosophy
- **Design for Flexibility**: Support the widest range of worlds and functionality
- **Free and Open Source**: Refine and enhance through community input and feedback
- **Ecosystem of Integration**: Foster open development with no commercial restrictions

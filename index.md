---
 

**OnlyWorlds** is a lightweight, text based, open source standard for defining digital worlds that enables data portability across applications. 
Worlds can be collaboratively developed in writing tools and mapping software, brought to life with game engines and showcase software.

This common format is hosted with tooling and infrastructure that enable world builders and world software builders to easily get started.
Create an account on [onlyworlds.com](https://www.onlyworlds.com) to host worlds and employ them in the [Tool Directory](../docs/tool-directory/). 

OnlyWorlds is open source and open license. Developers are encouraged to contribute through the [OnlyWorlds GitHub repository](https://github.com/OnlyWorlds/OnlyWorlds), and the [API specification](https://onlyworlds.com/api/docs) offers easy interfacing by external tools.

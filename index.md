**OnlyWorlds** is an open standard for worldbuilding. It defines 22 element categories with structured fields and relationships. OnlyWorlds-compatible worlds work across tools and support computational use.

Create worlds at [onlyworlds.com](https://onlyworlds.com/worlds) for use in [tools](/docs/tools), or [build your own software](/docs/development) with the open [API](/docs/development/api-reference), [SDKs](/docs/development/packages), and [AI solutions](/docs/development/ai).

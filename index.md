---
 

 
OnlyWorlds is a lightweight, text based, open source standard for defining digital worlds. It enables data portability across applications for writing, organizing, mapping, showcasing, simulating and gamifying worlds.
 

OnlyWorlds comes with a set of free tools that are listed in the [Tool Directory](../docs/tool-directory/). Free web services offered on [onlyworlds.com](https://www.onlyworlds.com) help you host, manage, and share your worlds.  

The framework is [open source](https://github.com/OnlyWorlds/OnlyWorlds), with developer support for integrating into new or existing applications. A [public API specification](https://onlyworlds.com/api/docs) offers clear and secure methods to read from, and write to, users' worlds. 

This documentation offers complete information on the project. Head to [Getting Started](../docs/getting-started/) to get acquainted with the project. The [Specification](../docs/specification/) section contains detailed technical information on how the framework is constructed.

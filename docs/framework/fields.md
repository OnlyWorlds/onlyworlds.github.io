## Fields

Each category in OnlyWorlds is defined by a set of fields that describe its qualities and connect them to other parts of the world.

For instance, all characters have a **Background** field where any amount of text can relate their origin stories.

They also each have a **Location** field that links them to Location elements, allowing you to specify where a character is at any point in time.

## Field Types

OnlyWorlds currently supports the following field types:

- Freeform **text**
- Positive whole **number**
- Positive whole **number** with an upper limit
- **Link** to a single element from a specific category
- **Link** to multiple elements from a specific category

## Core fields

Every element in OnlyWorlds shares these essential fields:

- **ID**: A unique identifier (non-editable)
- **Name**
- **Description**
- **Supertype**: Broad classifications within a category
- **Subtype**: Specific classifications within a supertype,
- **Image URL**: URL to a single image that represents the element

## Category-Specific Fields
 

Each category has its own distinct set of fields which you can view in the [categories](/docs/framework/categories/) section

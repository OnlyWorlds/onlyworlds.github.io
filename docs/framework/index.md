# Framework Overview

Worlds are contained in single text files, structured using JSON format. These single-text world definitions can easily be imported into or exported out of tools, by manual copy/paste or through a web server. 

The bulk of this world data consists of world **elements**: your characters, locations, creatures, and more.

OnlyWorlds currently defines 18 [categories](/docs/framework/categories/) of elements: from the more obvious **Character** to the less familiar **Construct** or **Title**.

Each of these categories has its own configuration of [fields](/docs/framework/fields/): named attributes that can hold text values, number values, or link to other elements. 

Every category also has a series of [typings](/docs/framework/typings/): (sub)categorizations that help structure and operate a world. 

These elements define a world together with a set of [world metadata](/docs/framework/world-metadata/).

Although far from finished, these current ideas are the result of several years of development on world creation tools and definitions. Take a look at the [origins](/docs/framework/origins/) page for more details on this process.

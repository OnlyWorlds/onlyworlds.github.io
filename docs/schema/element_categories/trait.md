Traits describe qualities that shape how a character or creature acts, responds, or is perceived. These are not active powers or learned abilities, but underlying aspects of identity.

--- 
  
Traits enrich the make up of actors. They interact with:

- **Characters** (holding traits and being shaped by them)
- **Abilities** (requiring, unlocking, or enhancing traits)
- **Species** (establishing cultural or biological expressions)

They are distinct from: 

- **Constructs** (which are not directly linked to actors)
- **Titles** (which are formally constructed, not potentially natural)

  <span class="ow-highlight">The Hegemony</span> Consul sat on the balcony of his ebony spaceship and played Rachmaninov's Prelude in C-sharp Minor on an ancient but well-maintained Steinway while great, green, saurian things surged and bellowed in the swamps below. A thunderstorm was brewing to the north. Bruise-black clouds silhouetted a forest of giant gymnosperms while stratocumulus towered nine kilometers high in a violent sky.

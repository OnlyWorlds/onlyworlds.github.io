# Concept

The heart of OnlyWorlds is a **data structure:** an agreement on how we format our worlds and their characters, maps, stories, dynamics and everything else. 

The **elements and dynamics** of a space-faring killer-bunny world can be described in **high-level abstractions** that also represent low-magic fantasy worlds: both worlds can be expected to include characters, objects, and locations. The challenge is to find the most **intuitive and flexible definitions** for these abstractions.

This is a process with **no perfect outcome or universal truth** to work towards: no two people will ever have the exact same approach and logic to how they structure their worlds and work.

But a 'decent mean' can be established, and the author strongly believes that a well-developed structure with sufficient customization can provide an agreeable experience for a large majority of world builders.

The reward for using a common standard is that **tools and applications** know how to represent worlds in data: your worlds will **not be limited** to single environments or stuck in walled gardens. 

Create your stories and elements in a **writing tool** of choice; then send over your world to a **mapping application** so you can physically locate them. Use other tools for **easy collaboration and displaying**, or ship it to any **games** that supports the format, from first-person exploring to economy simulators.  

Go to [framework](/docs/framework/) to see what this structure actually looks like.

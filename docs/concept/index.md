# Concept

The heart of OnlyWorlds is a **data structure:** an agreement on how we format our worlds and their characters, maps, stories, dynamics and everything else. 

The **elements and dynamics** of a space-faring killer-bunny world can be described in **high-level abstractions** that also represent low-magic fantasy worlds: both worlds can be expected to include characters, objects, and locations. The challenge is to find the most **intuitive and flexible definitions** for these abstractions.

This is a process with **no perfect outcome or universal truth** to work towards: no two people will ever have the exact same approach and logic to how they structure their worlds and work.

But a 'decent mean' can be established, and the author strongly believes that a well-developed structure with sufficient customization can provide an agreeable experience for a large majority of world builders.

The reward for using a common standard is that **tools and applications** know how to represent worlds in data: your worlds will **not be limited** to single environments or stuck in walled gardens. 

Create your stories and elements in a **writing tool** of choice; then send over your world to a **mapping application** so you can physically locate them. Use other tools for **easy collaboration and displaying**, or ship it to any **games** that supports the format, from first-person exploring to economy simulators. 

I have been working some time at identfying and structuring these flexible, usable definitions. But considering the scope and ambition of this project, it's still in an early stage. Your continuous feedback on what's there and what's not is essential to the quality of the outcome. 

It's a team effort to find the best definitions, and a team effort to create an ecosystem where this definition can flourish: anyone is invited and encouraged to create digital applications that support or integrate this format.

Creating tools or games with OnlyWorlds does not require you to look at any code: AI assistance will get you there, especially if you feed it the <a href="/assets/ow_llm_guide.txt" download>llm guide</a> and can reasonably describe what you want to build.

---

### Browser-based (zero setup)

Use any of the AI platforms that offer in-browser app and tool building.

Paste the llm guide contents into chat, describe your tool idea, iterate.

---

### Local development (recommended)

More control, better for ongoing projects.

**One-time setup:**
1. Create a [GitHub](https://github.com) account
2. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)
3. Install an IDE such as [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) or [Cursor](https://cursor.com)

**AI assistants**
such as:
- [Claude Code](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/setup) - terminal-based, recommended
- [Codex](https://openai.com/codex/) - OpenAI integration
- [Cursor](https://cursor.com) - IDE with built-in agents
- [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) - VS Code extension

**Workflow:**
1. Open terminal in your project folder
2. Feed the llm guide to your AI assistant
3. Describe what you want to build
4. Let AI help you set up, generate code, ask questions, iterate

# Schema Feedback

The OnlyWorlds specification is in active development. Field names, element categories, and relationships need community input and validation.

## Critical Questions

### Categories
- Missing element types for your world?
- Categories that overlap or confuse?
- Better names for existing categories?

### Fields  
- Confusing field names?
- Missing essential properties?
- Fields that should be links instead of text?
- Required fields that should be optional (or vice versa)?

### Relationships
- How should elements connect?
- Single vs multi-link decisions?
- Circular reference problems?

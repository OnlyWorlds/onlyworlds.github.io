# Tool Directory

The Tool Directory hosts free, secure tools for a broad range of world building use cases. 


---

## Tool Categories
 
### [Prototype Tools](prototype/) (7 tools)
Functional tools in active testing: potential for bugs, but generally usable for worldbuilding tasks.

### [Core Tools](core/) (0 tools)
Stable, tested, and proven useful.

---

## Development Pipeline

Tools progress through three stages:

1. **Submitted** → Initial security and compatibility review
2. **Prototype** → Community testing and bug fixing  
3. **Core** → Stable release with proven reliability

---

## Submission 

### Requirements  

Anyone can develop and distribute OnlyWorlds-enabled tools wherever and however they like. If you want to offer an application to the tool directory for broad general use, you can submit it for review and approval.

Tools that are submitted to this directory must be:

- Entirely free: no microtransactions, unlocks, or advertisements
- Securely and safely integrated with the OnlyWorlds standard


### Process

1. Ensure compatibility with OnlyWorlds specification
2. Create basic documentation, run basic tests
3. Submit via [GitHub](https://github.com/OnlyWorlds/OnlyWorlds) or [email](mailto:info@onlyworlds.com)
4. Pass security review
5. Enter prototype phase for community testing

---

## Token System

Some tools use AI features that require token allocation. Each OnlyWorlds account starts with 10,000 tokens daily. Increase your allocation by:
- Submitting feedback via Parse Tool
- Contributing to the ecosystem
- Supporting development

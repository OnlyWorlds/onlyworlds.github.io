## Tool Progression

All tools undergo community testing in Prototype. After proven stability, tools graduate to Core status.

**External submissions:** Review → Prototype → Core
**Direct additions:** Prototype → Core

[Base Tool](base/) available as LLM-ready development foundation.

## Token System

Some tools use AI features that require token allocation. Each OnlyWorlds account includes 10,000 tokens daily.

**Increase allocation by:**
- Submitting feedback via Parse Tool
- Contributing to the ecosystem
- Supporting development

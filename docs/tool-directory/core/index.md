---

## Graduation Criteria

Tools move from Prototype to Core when they demonstrate:
- **Stability** - Minimal bugs over extended testing period
- **Performance** - Responsive and efficient operation
- **Documentation** - Complete user guides and examples
- **Community validation** - Positive feedback and active use

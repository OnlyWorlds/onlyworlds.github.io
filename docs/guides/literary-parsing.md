## Example 1: Science Fiction (Hyperion)

### Section 1

The Hegemony Consul<a href="#" title="Character"><span class="material-symbols-outlined">person_4</span></a> sat on the balcony of his ebony spaceship<a href="#" title="Object"><span class="material-symbols-outlined">webhook</span></a> and played Rachmaninov's Prelude in C-sharp Minor on an ancient but well-maintained Steinway<a href="#" title="Object"><span class="material-symbols-outlined">webhook</span></a> while great, green, saurian things<a href="#" title="Creature"><span class="material-symbols-outlined">bug_report</span></a> surged and bellowed in the swamps below<a href="#" title="Location"><span class="material-symbols-outlined">castle</span></a>. A thunderstorm<a href="#" title="Phenomenon"><span class="material-symbols-outlined">thunderstorm</span></a> was brewing to the north. Bruise-black clouds silhouetted a forest of giant gymnosperms<a href="#" title="Location"><span class="material-symbols-outlined">castle</span></a> while stratocumulus towered nine kilometers high in a violent sky. Lightning rippled along the horizon. Closer to the ship, occasional vague, reptilian shapes would blunder into the interdiction field<a href="#" title="Object"><span class="material-symbols-outlined">webhook</span></a>, cry out, and then crash away through indigo mists. The Consul concentrated on a difficult section of the Prelude and ignored the approach of storm and nightfall. The fatline receiver<a href="#" title="Object"><span class="material-symbols-outlined">webhook</span></a> chimed.

### Section 2

'You have been chosen to return to Hyperion<a href="#" title="Location"><span class="material-symbols-outlined">castle</span></a>,' came a woman's husky voice. Full visuals had not yet formed; the air remained empty except for the pulse of transmission codes which told the Consul that this fatline squirt had originated on the Hegemony administrative world of Tau Ceti Center<a href="#" title="Location"><span class="material-symbols-outlined">castle</span></a>. The Consul did not need the transmission coordinates to know this. The aged but still beautiful voice of Meina Gladstone<a href="#" title="Character"><span class="material-symbols-outlined">person_4</span></a> was unmistakable. 'You have been chosen to return to Hyperion as a member of the Shrike Pilgrimage<a href="#" title="Institution"><span class="material-symbols-outlined">business</span></a>,' continued the voice.

**Location: Hyperion** - Celestial - Planet

### Section 3

'You and six others have been selected by the Church of the Shrike<a href="#" title="Institution"><span class="material-symbols-outlined">business</span></a> and confirmed by the All Thing,' said Meina Gladstone. 'It is in the interest of the Hegemony<a href="#" title="Institution"><span class="material-symbols-outlined">business</span></a> that you accept.' The Consul stood motionless in the pit, his back to the flickering transmission codes. Without turning, he raised his glass and drained the last of the Scotch. 'The situation is very confused,' said Meina Gladstone. Her voice was weary. 'The consulate and Home Rule Council fatlined us three standard weeks ago with the news that the Time Tombs<a href="#" title="Location"><span class="material-symbols-outlined">castle</span></a> showed signs of opening. The anti-entropic fields around them were expanding rapidly and the Shrike<a href="#" title="Creature"><span class="material-symbols-outlined">bug_report</span></a> has begun ranging as far south as the Bridle Range<a href="#" title="Location"><span class="material-symbols-outlined">castle</span></a>.'

### Section 4

'FORCE<a href="#" title="Institution"><span class="material-symbols-outlined">business</span></a>:space task force was immediately dispatched from Parvati<a href="#" title="Location"><span class="material-symbols-outlined">castle</span></a> to evacuate the Hegemony citizens on Hyperion before the Time Tombs open. Their time-debt will be a little more than three Hyperion years.' Meina Gladstone paused. The Consul thought he had never seen the Senate CEO look so grim. 'We do not know if the evacuation fleet will arrive in time,' she said, 'but the situation is even more complicated. An Ouster<a href="#" title="Species"><span class="material-symbols-outlined">crib</span></a> migration cluster of at least four thousand . . . units . . . has been detected approaching the Hyperion system<a href="#" title="Location"><span class="material-symbols-outlined">castle</span></a>. Our evacuation task force should arrive only a short while before the Ousters.'

### Section 5

'Sol Weintraub<a href="#" title="Character"><span class="material-symbols-outlined">person_4</span></a> and Fedmahn Kassad<a href="#" title="Character"><span class="material-symbols-outlined">person_4</span></a> are among the seven pilgrims chosen,' said Gladstone. The Consul's frown deepened. He stared at the cloud of digits flickering like dust motes around the old woman's image. Fifteen seconds of fatline transmission time remained. 'We need your help,' said Meina Gladstone. 'It is essential that the secrets of the Time Tombs and Shrike be uncovered. This pilgrimage may be our last chance. If the Ousters conquer Hyperion, their agent must be eliminated and the Time Tombs sealed at all cost. The fate of the Hegemony may depend upon it.'

## Example 2: Historical Fiction (The Wager)

### Section 1

Each man in the squadron<a href="#" title="Institution"><span class="material-symbols-outlined">business</span></a> carried, along with a sea chest<a href="#" title="Object"><span class="material-symbols-outlined">webhook</span></a>, his own burdensome story. Perhaps it was of a scorned love, or a secret prison conviction, or a pregnant wife left on shore weeping. Perhaps it was a hunger for fame and fortune<a href="#" title="Trait"><span class="material-symbols-outlined">flaky</span></a>, or a dread of death<a href="#" title="Trait"><span class="material-symbols-outlined">flaky</span></a>. David Cheap<a href="#" title="Character"><span class="material-symbols-outlined">person_4</span></a>, the first lieutenant<a href="#" title="Title"><span class="material-symbols-outlined">military_tech</span></a> of the Centurion<a href="#" title="Object"><span class="material-symbols-outlined">webhook</span></a>, the squadron's flagship, was no different. A burly Scotsman<a href="#" title="Species"><span class="material-symbols-outlined">crib</span></a> in his early forties with a protracted nose and intense eyes, he was in flight—from squabbles with his brother over their inheritance, from creditors chasing him, from debts that made it impossible for him to find a suitable bride.

**Institution: The Squadron** - Military - Fleet  
**Object: Sea Chest** - Object - Item  
**Trait: Hunger for Fame and Fortune** - Ambition  
**Trait: Dread of Death** - Dread  
**Character: David Cheap** - Human - Commander  
**Title: First Lieutenant of the Centurion** - Leadership - Executive  
**Object: Centurion** - Vehicle - Ship  
**Species: Scottish** - Ethnicity

### Section 2

Onshore, Cheap seemed doomed, unable to navigate past life's unexpected shoals. Yet as he perched on the quarterdeck of a British man-of-war, cruising the vast oceans with a cocked hat and spyglass<a href="#" title="Object"><span class="material-symbols-outlined">webhook</span></a>, he brimmed with confidence<a href="#" title="Trait"><span class="material-symbols-outlined">flaky</span></a>—even, some would say, a touch of haughtiness. The wooden world of a ship<a href="#" title="Construct"><span class="material-symbols-outlined">api</span></a>—a world bound by the Navy's rigid regulations<a href="#" title="Law"><span class="material-symbols-outlined">gpp_bad</span></a> and the laws of the sea and, most of all, by the hardened fellowship of men—had provided him a refuge. Suddenly he felt a crystalline order, a clarity of purpose. And Cheap's newest posting, despite the innumerable risks that it carried, from plagues<a href="#" title="Phenomenon"><span class="material-symbols-outlined">thunderstorm</span></a> and drowning to enemy cannon fire<a href="#" title="Construct"><span class="material-symbols-outlined">api</span></a>, offered what he longed for: a chance to finally claim a wealthy prize<a href="#" title="Construct"><span class="material-symbols-outlined">api</span></a> and rise to captain his own ship, becoming a lord of the sea.

**Construct: Wealthy Prize** - Situation - Acquisition

### Section 3

The problem was that he could not get away from the damned land. He was trapped—cursed, really—at the dockyard in Portsmouth<a href="#" title="Location"><span class="material-symbols-outlined">castle</span></a>, along the English Channel<a href="#" title="Location"><span class="material-symbols-outlined">castle</span></a>, struggling with feverish futility to get the Centurion fitted out and ready to sail. Its massive wooden hull<a href="#" title="Object"><span class="material-symbols-outlined">webhook</span></a>, 144 feet long and 40 feet wide, was moored at a slip. Carpenters<a href="#" title="Construct"><span class="material-symbols-outlined">api</span></a>, caulkers, riggers<a href="#" title="Construct"><span class="material-symbols-outlined">api</span></a>, and joiners<a href="#" title="Construct"><span class="material-symbols-outlined">api</span></a> combed over its decks like rats<a href="#" title="Species"><span class="material-symbols-outlined">crib</span></a> (which were also plentiful). A cacophony of hammers<a href="#" title="Object"><span class="material-symbols-outlined">webhook</span></a> and saws<a href="#" title="Object"><span class="material-symbols-outlined">webhook</span></a>.

**Object: Saw** - Object - Tool

### Section 4

The cobblestone streets<a href="#" title="Location"><span class="material-symbols-outlined">castle</span></a> past the shipyard were congested with rattling wheelbarrows and horse-drawn wagons, with porters<a href="#" title="Construct"><span class="material-symbols-outlined">api</span></a>, peddlers<a href="#" title="Construct"><span class="material-symbols-outlined">api</span></a>, pickpockets<a href="#" title="Construct"><span class="material-symbols-outlined">api</span></a>, sailors<a href="#" title="Construct"><span class="material-symbols-outlined">api</span></a>, and prostitutes<a href="#" title="Construct"><span class="material-symbols-outlined">api</span></a>. Periodically, a boatswain<a href="#" title="Title"><span class="material-symbols-outlined">military_tech</span></a> blew a chilling whistle<a href="#" title="Object"><span class="material-symbols-outlined">webhook</span></a>, and crewmen stumbled from ale shops<a href="#" title="Construct"><span class="material-symbols-outlined">api</span></a>, parting from old or new sweethearts, hurrying to their departing ships in order to avoid their officers' lashes<a href="#" title="Construct"><span class="material-symbols-outlined">api</span></a>.

### Section 5

It was January 1740, and the British Empire<a href="#" title="Institution"><span class="material-symbols-outlined">business</span></a> was racing to mobilize for war against its imperial rival Spain<a href="#" title="Institution"><span class="material-symbols-outlined">business</span></a>. And in a move that had suddenly raised Cheap's prospects, the captain under whom he served on the Centurion, George Anson<a href="#" title="Character"><span class="material-symbols-outlined">person_4</span></a>, had been plucked by the Admiralty<a href="#" title="Institution"><span class="material-symbols-outlined">business</span></a> to be a commodore<a href="#" title="Title"><span class="material-symbols-outlined">military_tech</span></a> and lead the squadron of five warships against the Spanish. The promotion was unexpected. As the son of an obscure country squire, Anson did not wield the level of patronage<a href="#" title="Construct"><span class="material-symbols-outlined">api</span></a>, the grease—or "interest," as it was more politely called—that propelled many officers up the pole, along with their men.

**Character: George Anson** - Human - Leader  
**Institution: Admiralty** - Division - Strategic  
**Title: Commodore** - Leadership - Commanding  
**Construct: Patronage** - Situation - Acquisition

### Section 6

Anson, then forty-two, had joined the Navy at the age of fourteen, and served for nearly three decades without leading a major military campaign or snaring a lucrative prize. Tall, with a long face and a high forehead, he had a remoteness<a href="#" title="Trait"><span class="material-symbols-outlined">flaky</span></a> about him. His blue eyes were inscrutable<a href="#" title="Trait"><span class="material-symbols-outlined">flaky</span></a>, and outside the company of a few trusted friends he rarely opened his mouth. One statesman, after meeting with him, noted, "Anson, as usual, said little<a href="#" title="Trait"><span class="material-symbols-outlined">flaky</span></a>."

**Trait: Remoteness** - Temperament

# Specification Overview

OnlyWorlds are defined through a single JSON file that encapsulates [world metadata](/docs/framework/world-metadata/) and the world elements that make up the structure of your world.

These elements are divided into 18 distinct [categories](/docs/framework/categories/), designed to represent all aspects of world building.

Each category is configured with its own set of [fields](/docs/framework/fields/), which are named attributes capable of holding text, numeric values, or links to other elements.

Additionally, each category includes a system of [typings](/docs/framework/typings/), which are sub-categorizations that further refine and organize the elements within the world.

Creatures are living entities within a world that exhibit behavior and agency but lack the strategic reasoning, narrative focus, or social complexity of Characters. Their role is typically reactive over proactive, but they can still play important parts in a worldâ€™s ecology, mythology, or atmosphere.

Creatures help populate the world with living presence. They interact with:

    Species (defining their biological origin or variation)

    Traits and Abilities (for what they can do or how they can act)

    Locations and Zones (the spaces they inhabit)

    Characters and Institutions (as caretakers, enemies, or breeders)

They are distinct from:

    Characters (who possess intent, narrative relevance, and structured goals)

    Objects (which are inanimate)

    Phenomena (which are forces or occurrences, not beings)

A Title is a formal designation that confers identity, standing, or power within a world. It may be granted, inherited, or assumed, and often functions within a wider system of governance, belief, or custom. Titles help structure how individuals relate to institutions, spaces, and ideas across time.

Titles define structured identity and power. They interact with:

- **Characters** (holding titles)
- **Institutions** (issuing or hosting titles)
- **Zones, Locations, Objects** (governing or representing)
- **Constructs, Laws, and Collectives** (giving them shape or purpose)

They are distinct from:

- **Traits** (which describe personal attributes)
- **Abilities** (which define actions that can physically be taken)
- **Relations** (which describe personal or emotional bonds)

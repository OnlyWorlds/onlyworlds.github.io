 Narratives represent stories told in your world, and can involve the organization or reinterpretation of Events.  

--- 
   
Narratives are how stories are expressed in a world. They interact with:

    Events (the actual happenings they group or reinterpret)

    Characters, Institutions, and Families (as storytellers or subjects)

    Objects, Constructs, and Laws (as story elements or consequences)

    Titles, Relations, and Collectives (as sources of tension or resolution)

They are distinct from:

    Events (which record what happened without particular subjectivity)

    Constructs (which express abstract ideas but not narrative form)

    Relations (which may exist inside a story, but don't organize one)

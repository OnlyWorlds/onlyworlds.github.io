Narratives represent stories told in your world, and can involve the organization or reinterpretation of Events.  

--- 
   
Narratives are how stories are expressed in a world. They interact with:

- **Events** (the actual happenings they group or reinterpret)
- **Characters, Institutions, and Families** (as storytellers or subjects)
- **Objects, Constructs, and Laws** (as story elements or consequences)
- **Titles, Relations, and Collectives** (as sources of tension or resolution)

They are distinct from:

- **Events** (which record what happened without particular subjectivity)
- **Constructs** (which express abstract ideas but not narrative form)
- **Relations** (which may exist inside a story, but don't organize one)

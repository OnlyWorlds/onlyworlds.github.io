A Location represents a distinct place within the world where activities occur and elements converge. Locations serve as anchors for other world elements, and describe how physical spaces are used, who organizes them, and how they relate to other places.

Locations are a structural backbone of your world. They interact with:

    Collectives and Characters (who inhabit or pass through them)

    Institutions and Laws (which govern or control them)

    Objects and Titles (which exist within or are tied to them)

    Events and Narratives (which often take place in or around them)

They are distinct from:

    Zones (which represent a specific marked area) 

    Institutions (which organize power and policy within and towards them)

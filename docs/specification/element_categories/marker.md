A Marker is a special Map element. Groups of Markers, each at a specific coordinate, together desginate a Zone in the world.

Markers are for painting the Zones of your world. They interact with:

    Maps (Markers exist on only one map at a time)

    Zones (A miminum of three Markers together defines one Zone) 

They are distinct from:

    Pins (which locate an element at a specific coordinate on a Map)

Languages are systems of shared meaning, whether natural, constructed, or symbolic. This category captures their role within a world: how they sound, how they are written, how they function grammatically, and where or by whom they are used. Languages may carry political weight, cultural importance, or fictional depth. The category's fields are designed to support both lightweight notation and full conlang development.

Languages are a world's methods of communication. They interact with:

- **Characters, Species, and Creatures** (who speak, shape, or inherit them)
- **Locations and Zones** (where languages are regionally dominant or isolated)
- **Constructs** (for classifying broader typological or ancestral groups)

They are distinct from:

- **Constructs** (which include ideas, systems, or tools not tied to speech)
- **Traits** (which describe how a character expresses themselves, but not the system of expression)

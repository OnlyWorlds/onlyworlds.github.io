A Family is a group tied together by lineage, heritage or community.

--- 
  
A Family is a group tied together by lineage, heritage or community. They interact with:

- **Characters** (who are members, descendants or ancestors)
- **Traits, Abilities, and Languages** (passed down or shared)
- **Objects and Creatures** (as heirlooms or symbols)
- **Institutions and Locations** (which they govern or inhabit)

They are distinct from:

- **Institutions** (which organize for more general purposes)
- **Collectives** (which group by circumstance, not inheritance)

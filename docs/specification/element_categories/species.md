Species defines a distinct biological or cultural form of life. They help define how life functions or diverges across environments and histories.

--- 
  
 Species shape physical and behavioral defaults of a world. They interact with:

    Characters and Creatures (defined as members of species)

    Locations and Zones (determining habitat and environmental interaction)

    Traits and Constructs (expressing shared abilities or mythic significance)

They are distinct from:

    Characters (individual agents with goals and identity)

    Creatures (instinct-driven individuals)

    Collectives (behavioral groups of individuals)

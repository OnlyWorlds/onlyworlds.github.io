Species defines a distinct biological or cultural form of life. They help define how life functions or diverges across environments and histories.

--- 
  
Species shape physical and behavioral defaults of a world. They interact with:

- **Characters and Creatures** (defined as members of species)
- **Locations and Zones** (determining habitat and environmental interaction)
- **Traits and Constructs** (expressing shared abilities or mythic significance)

They are distinct from:

- **Characters** (individual agents with goals and identity)
- **Creatures** (instinct-driven individuals)
- **Collectives** (behavioral groups of individuals)

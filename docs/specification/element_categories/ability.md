An Ability represents something an entity in the world can do: a defined action, power, skill, or effect that can change the world or its perception. Abilities are performable and traceable: they have causes, consequences, and conditions. They can be passive traits, active powers, or conditional techniques. 

---

An Ability is a performable effect or power. They interact with:

- **Characters and Creatures** (as actors who employ them)  
- **Traits** (which may grant or enhance them)  
- **Objects and Constructs** (that might enable or constrain them)  
- **Phenomena** (which may result from or trigger them)  
- **Institutions** (which can teach or restrict them)  

They are distinct from:

- **Traits** (which describe qualities, not actions)   
- **Events** (which describe outcomes or occurrences, not repeatable powers)

### Mechanics
- **Activation**: Method or conditions under which the ability is activated
- **Duration** (#): Length of time the ability remains active or its effects persist, measured in TIME units
- **Potency** (# max:100): Relative measure of the ability's inherent potency or force, used for scaling or comparison purposes
- **Range** (#): Effective reach or distance at which the ability can be used, measured in DISTANCE units
- **Effects** (multi-link: Phenomenon): Phenomena that result from the ability's use, such as environmental changes or sensory effects
- **Challenges**: Describes specific difficulties or constraints that make the ability hard to master or use effectively
- **Talents** (multi-link: Trait): Traits that naturally enhance or improve performance with this ability
- **Requisites** (multi-link: Construct): Constructs that must be satisfied for the ability to be used, such as rituals, permissions, or required roles

### World
- **Prevalence**: How widely the ability is known or practiced, and potential clues to its origins and cultural diffusion
- **Tradition** (single-link: Construct): A construct that expresses the conceptual, social, or institutional system this ability operates within
- **Source** (single-link: Phenomenon): The phenomenon that serves as the enabling force or condition that allows this ability to function
- **Locus** (single-link: Location): Location where the ability is most strongly rooted, developed, or traditionally practiced
- **Instruments** (multi-link: Object): Objects or tools required to activate, channel, or perform the ability
- **Systems** (multi-link: Construct): Magic frameworks or structures that the ability associates with

Abilities describe actions or powers that entities in a world are capable of performing. Each ability defines not just what is possible, but how it functions, what enables it, and how it fits into the world around it. Some may be tied to tradition or place, others to traits or tools. Together, abilities help express what kinds of influence or transformation are available within a given setting, and how they are accessed, constrained, or maintained.

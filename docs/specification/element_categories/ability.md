An Ability represents something an entity in the world can do: a defined action, power, skill, or effect that can change the world or its perception. Abilities are performable and traceable: they have causes, consequences, and conditions. They can be passive traits, active powers, or conditional techniques. 
---

An Ability is a performable effect or power. They interact with:

- **Characters and Creatures** (as actors who employ them)  
- **Traits** (which may grant or enhance them)  
- **Objects and Constructs** (that might enable or constrain them)  
- **Phenomena** (which may result from or trigger them)  
- **Institutions** (which can teach or restrict them)  

They are distinct from:

- **Traits** (which describe qualities, not actions)   
- **Events** (which describe outcomes or occurrences, not repeatable powers)

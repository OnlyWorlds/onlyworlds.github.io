Traits describe qualities that shape how a character or creature acts, responds, or is perceived. These are not active powers or learned abilities, but underlying aspects of identity.

--- 
  
Traits enrich the make up of actors. They interact with:

    Characters (holding traits and being shaped by them)

    Abilities (requiring, unlocking, or enhancing traits)

    Species (establishing cultural or biological expressions)

They are distinct from: 

    Constructs (which are not directly linked to actors)

    Titles (which are formally constructed, not potentially natural)

Constructs are abstract or conceptual structures that exist within a world and can have causal, symbolic, or systemic roles.
They are non-physical, non-character entities that help explain or organize how the world works. Constructs shape cultures, behaviors, and institutions by providing internal logic or justification for how things work. They are not universal truths, but frameworks that are made, sustained and lost over time.

Constructs describe structured ideas or systems that the world acknowledges or operates through. They interact with:

- **Characters** (who invent, oppose, or live by them)
- **Institutions** (that organize, enforce, or exploit them)
- **Objects and Abilities** (which might manifest or otherwise relate to them)
- **Languages, Titles, and Traits** (to carry or symbolize them)

They are distinct from:

- **Laws** (which are more externalized, often enforceable by rule)
- **Phenomena** (which are observed and natural rather than believed or structured)
- **Narratives** (which explain or contain constructs)

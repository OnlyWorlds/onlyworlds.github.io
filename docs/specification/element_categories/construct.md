A Construct is an idea or system that operates within a world as a formalized concept: something concepted, shared, and acted upon. It might be a magical law, an ideology, a belief, or a philosophical model. Constructs shape cultures, behaviors, and institutions by providing internal logic or justification for how things work. They are not universal truths, but frameworks that are made, sustained and lost over time.

Constructs describe structured ideas or systems that the world acknowledges or operates through. They interact with:

    Objects (which are physical, singular entities; constructs can define objects, but are never material)

    Characters (who invent, oppose, or live by them)

    Institutions (that organize, enforce, or exploit them)

    Objects and Abilities (which might manifest or otherwise relate to them)

    Languages, Titles, and Traits (to carry or symbolize them)

They are distinct from:

    Laws (which are more externalized, often enforceable by rule)

    Phenomena (which are observed and natural rather than believed or structured)

    Narratives (which explain or contain constructs)

Events are time-bound happenings in the world. An Event refers to any notable incident, whether historical, natural, or supernatural, that has any kind of significant for the world or any of its inhabitants. They are meta-level elements of instantaneous or prolonged duration that can involve other element types.

Events are defined occurrences. They pull in and affect:

- **Characters, Collectives, and Institutions** (as agents or sufferers)
- **Zones and Locations** (as settings or battlegrounds)
- **Constructs and Laws** (as outcomes or contested forces)
- **Traits, Titles, and Abilities** (as qualities or catalysts)
- **Phenomena, Creatures, and Objects** (as elements in motion)

They are distinct from:

- **Narratives** (which reinterpret potential collections of Events)
- **Constructs** (which represent ideas or systems that persist over time)
- **Relations** (which define ongoing bonds or tensions between actors)

Events are about what happens. The rest of the schema gives it meaning, context, and consequence.

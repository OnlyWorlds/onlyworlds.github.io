A Character is a self-directed actor with the capacity to choose, respond, and shape the world around them. Characters serve as the central drivers of change across most worlds. They tend to have complex motivations, personal history, and the ability to form meaningful relationships.

A Character is an individual with agency. They interact with:

- **Species** (defining their biological or cultural blueprints)  
- **Traits and Abilities** (defining their nature and powers)  
- **Objects and Constructs** (defining what they own, carry, or believe)  
- **Institutions, Territories, and Events** (contexts they affect or are affected by)  
- **Families, Collectives, and Relations** (their networks and bonds)

They are distinct from:

- **Creatures** (which lack reasoned choices or structured goals)  
- **Collectives** (which model group entities without individual agency)

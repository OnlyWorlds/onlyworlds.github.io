A Character is an individual actor with agency, perspective, and presence in the world. Characters may be human, humanoid, or non-human, and can represent a wide range of roles from central protagonists to minor background figures. Each Character is defined by their body and mind, their relationships and affiliations, their personal story and goals, and their capacity to affect the world around them.

Characters are the primary agents of change. They interact with:
*    Species (defining their biological or cultural blueprints)
*    Traits and Abilities (defining their nature and powers)
*    Objects and Constructs (defining what they own, carry, or believe)
*    Institutions, Territories, and Events (contexts they affect or are affected by)
*    Families, Collectives, and Relations (their networks and bonds)

They are distinct from:
*    Creatures (which lack reasoned choices or structured goals),
*    Collectives (which model group entities)

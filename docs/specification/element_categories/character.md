# Character

**Definition**

*Any individual actor with agency and/or autonomy*

A Character embodies any being with agency, capable of making choices and influencing the world around them. Can range from human individuals to mythical creatures or intelligent beings of any species.

**Examples**
- The Consul 
- Smaug the dragon
- You


**[Discussion](https://github.com/OnlyWorlds/OnlyWorlds/discussions/categories/Character)**

Potential alternate names: *Agent, Person, Individual, Actor, ..*
 
When does a clever Creature become a Character? This line might be ultimately too subjective to provide specific rules for, so it is up to the builder to define what constitutes a Character in their worlds.

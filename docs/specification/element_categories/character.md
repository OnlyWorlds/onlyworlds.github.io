<h2><span class="material-symbols-outlined">person_4</span><br>Character</h2>
<br>
Embodies any individual actor defined by their agency and capacity to make choices that influence the world around them. Characters tend to have complex motivations, personal history, and the ability to form meaningful relationships.

### Key Points
 
* **Agency vs. Instinct** <br>
The line between a highly intelligent `Creature` and a `Character` can be subjective. If an entity makes reasoned choices, has self awareness, and plays a distinct role beyond simple behavior patterns, it will probably qualify as a Character.
* **Character Relations** <br>
Some fields (Family, Friends, Relations) provide direct or indirect relational settings between Characters. These can be further augmented through the Relation(LINK) element.
* **Personality** <br>
coercion etc

Characters are the primary agents of change. They interact with:
*    Species (defining their biological or cultural blueprints)
*    Traits and Abilities (defining their nature and powers)
*    Objects and Constructs (defining what they own, carry, or believe)
*    Institutions, Territories, and Events (contexts they affect or are affected by)
*    Families, Collectives, and Relations (their networks and bonds)

They are distinct from:
*    Creatures (which lack reasoned choices or structured goals),
*    Collectives (which model group entities)

*A system of rules and penalties built on claims to authority*

A Law is a formalized set of guidelines or commands that govern the actions of individuals or groups within a specific jurisdiction.

Laws are formal rules issued by an authority to guide behavior, establish boundaries, or enforce order within a world. They define what is permitted or prohibited, outline consequences for violations, and specify who interprets and enforces them. Laws can be administrative, punitive, or symbolic, and may carry legal, cultural, or spiritual significance.

Laws are formalized rules that govern behavior within a jurisdiction. They interact with:

- **Institutions** (which often issue them)
- **Locations and Zones** (which define where they apply)
- **Titles** (which define who upholds them or judges them)
- **Constructs** (which describe the abstract concepts they prohibit or rely on)

They are distinct from:

- **Constructs** (which describe the abstract concepts they prohibit or rely on)
- **Institutions** (which often issue them but are not rules themselves)
- **Titles** (which define authority but not the rules themselves)

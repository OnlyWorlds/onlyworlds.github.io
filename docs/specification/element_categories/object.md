Objects are tangible, non-living things that can be made, own, traded or destroyed. They can enable abilities, consume resources, trigger phenomena and shape stories.

---

Objects are a core material element of worlds. They interact with:

    Traits and Abilities (which determine who can use them and how)

    Locations (which define where they are stored or used)

    Characters (who own or interact with them)

    Phenomena (which they may emit, trigger, or be affected by)

They are distinct from:

    Constructs (which define their underlying principles or technologies

    Creatures and Characters (which are animate)

    Phenomena (which represent ongoing effects or supernatural features)

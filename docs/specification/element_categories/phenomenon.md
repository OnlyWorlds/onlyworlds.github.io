Phenomena are ongoing or emergent conditions that act in or upon the world. They are not defined by intent or agency, but might be wielded or enabled by other elements.
--- 
  
Phenomena interact with the rest of the world in some meaningful ways, including:

    Traits and Abilities (enhancing or being enhanced)

    Objects and Constructs (trigger or affected)

    Characters (wielding or enabling)

    Locations (appear or enrich) 

They are distinct from:

    Events (which are dated incidents of history)

    Constructs (which are designed or conceptual structures)

    Abilities (which are agent-bound)

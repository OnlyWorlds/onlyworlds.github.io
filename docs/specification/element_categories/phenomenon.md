Phenomena are ongoing or emergent conditions that act in or upon the world. They are not defined by intent or agency, but might be wielded or enabled by other elements.

--- 
  
Phenomena interact with the rest of the world in some meaningful ways, including:

- **Characters** (wielding or enabling)
- **Traits and Abilities** (enhancing or being enhanced)
- **Objects and Constructs** (trigger or affected)
- **Locations** (appear or enrich)

They are distinct from:

- **Events** (which are dated incidents of history)
- **Constructs** (which are designed or conceptual structures)
- **Abilities** (which are agent-bound)

Zones represent abstract or meaningful areas within the world that hold significance due to cultural, political, environmental, or narrative reasons. They are not defined by geometry themselves but gain spatial presence through linked map markers. Zones can be used to track boundaries, effects, or jurisdictions that extend beyond a single location.

Zones are spatial definitions within a world. They interact with:

    Maps (that a zone exists on)

    Institutions (which define or claim zones)

    Creatures (that dominate or traverse them)

    Phenomena (that enrich or transform the area)

    Titles (for roles tied to management or protection)

They are distinct from:

    Locations (which are specific places of interest or activity) 

    Markers (which define the geometry of a zone on a map)

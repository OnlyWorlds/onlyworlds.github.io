Relations are non-material and capture meaningful connections between world elements. They track interactions, alignments, conflicts, or agreements between characters, groups, places, and other entities.

Relations are special definitions between world elements. They interact with:

- **Characters and Institutions** (defining personal and organizational relationships)
- **Events** (arising from or recognizing a relationship)
- **Objects, Zones, Traits, and Abilities** (as things exchanged, contested, or shared)

They are distinct from:

- **Titles** (which indicate formal authority, not interpersonal context)
- **Events** (which define a point in time, not a social span)
- **Constructs** (which encode rules or structures, not associations between elements)
- **Families and Collectives** (which describe structure, not necessarily activity)

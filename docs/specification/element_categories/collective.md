A Collective is a group of individuals that acts as a unit but lacks formal governance or hierarchical structure. Collectives range from spontaneous mobs to herds of animals, and are unified by shared traits, contexts, or purpose. 


--- 

A Collective is a loosely organized group defined by common identity or circumstance, not by structure or command. They interact with:

- **Characters and Creatures** (who form their body)
- **Species** (defining their biological foundation(s))
- **Constructs and Abilities** (shaping what they do and believe)
- **Institutions** (which may organize or employ them)
- **Phenomena** (that bind or affect them)

They are distinct from:

- **Institutions** (which govern, plan, and wield power)
- **Families** (which define genetic or cultural lineage)

A Collective is a group of individuals that acts as a unit but lacks formal governance or hierarchical structure. Collectives range from spontaneous mobs to herds of animals, and are unified by shared traits, contexts, or purpose. 
Unlike Institutions, Collectives don't issue orders or carry authority, but they still shape the world through numbers, mood, and presence. Collectives are useful when the world needs crowds, masses, or forces that aren't in charge, but can change outcomes.

A Collective is a loosely organized group defined by common identity or circumstance, not by structure or command. They interact with:

- **Characters and Creatures** (who form their body)
- **Species** (defining their biological foundation(s))
- **Constructs and Abilities** (shaping what they do and believe)
- **Institutions** (which may organize or employ them)
- **Phenomena** (that bind or affect them)

They are distinct from:

- **Institutions** (which govern, plan, and wield power)
- **Families** (which define genetic or cultural lineage)

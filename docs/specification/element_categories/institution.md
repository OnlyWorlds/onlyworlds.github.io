Institutions are organized bodies with purpose and structure. They shape the world through policy, territory, and culture, and may range from governments to guilds, or from churches to corporations. Institutions often serve as key agents of power, coordinating individuals and collectives around shared goals, practices, or ideologies.

Institutions are organizational forces in a world. They interact with:

    Territories, Objects, and Creatures (defining what they own or control)

    Laws and Constructs (defining what they enforce, create or utilize) 

    Characters (through Titles, which connect people to institutions)

They are distinct from:

    Collectives (which model informal or non-structured groups)

    Families (which imply kinship, not structure)

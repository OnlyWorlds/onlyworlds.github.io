Institutions are organized bodies with purpose and structure. They shape the world through policy, organization, and culture. Institutions can serve as key agents of power, coordinating individuals and collectives around shared goals, practices, or ideologies. 

--- 

Institutions are executive structures of meaning in a world. They interact with:

- **Characters and Titles** (placing people in institutions)
- **Zones, Objects, and Creatures** (what they define or control)
- **Laws and Constructs** (what they enforce, create or utilize)

They are distinct from:

- **Collectives** (which model informal or non-agentic groups)
- **Families** (which have implications of kinship and ancestry)

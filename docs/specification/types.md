Types provide optional classification within element categories using two fields: `supertype` and `subtype`.

---

## Using Types

Both fields accept any string value. Suggested defaults exist for some categories but are incomplete and subject to change.

**Fantasy character:**
- Category: `character`
- Supertype: `Humanoid`
- Subtype: `Elf`

**Sci-fi location:**
- Category: `location`
- Supertype: `Spaceborne`
- Subtype: `Station`

## Status

**Draft**: Current suggestions are preliminary, incomplete, and not enforced. Use any values that fit your world.

**Future**: This system will evolve into genre-specific templates (fantasy, sci-fi, historical) with validation rules and custom template support.

---

Use types for organization, not validation. Custom values work better than waiting for suggested defaults.

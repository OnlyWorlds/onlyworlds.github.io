*An enormous man <a href="/docs/specification/element_categories/Character" title="Character"><span class="material-symbols-outlined" style="font-size: 18px;">person_4</span></a> dressed in an oilcloth slicker <a href="/docs/specification/element_categories/Object" title="Object"><span class="material-symbols-outlined" style="font-size: 18px;">webhook</span></a> had entered the tent <a href="/docs/specification/element_categories/Location" title="Location"><span class="material-symbols-outlined" style="font-size: 18px;">castle</span></a>
and removed his hat. He was bald as a stone and he had no trace of beard and he had
no brows to his eyes nor lashes to them. <a href="/docs/specification/element_categories/Trait" title="Trait"><span class="material-symbols-outlined" style="font-size: 18px;">flaky</span></a>*

*The reverend had stopped his sermon <a href="/docs/specification/element_categories/Construct" title="Construct"><span class="material-symbols-outlined" style="font-size: 18px;">api</span></a> altogether. There was no sound in the tent.
All watched the man. He adjusted the hat and then pushed his way forward <a href="/docs/specification/element_categories/Event" title="Event"><span class="material-symbols-outlined" style="font-size: 18px;">saved_search</span></a> as far as the
crateboard pulpit where the reverend stood and there he turned to address the
reverend's congregation.<a href="/docs/specification/element_categories/Collective" title="Collective"><span class="material-symbols-outlined" style="font-size: 18px;">groups_3</span></a>*

*His face was serene and strangely childlike. His hands were small. He held them out.*


*Ladies and gentlemen I feel it my duty to inform you that the man <a href="/docs/specification/element_categories/Species" title="Species"><span class="material-symbols-outlined" style="font-size: 18px;">crib</span></a> holding this revival is an imposter. He holds no papers of divinity <a href="/docs/specification/element_categories/Language" title="Language"><span class="material-symbols-outlined" style="font-size: 18px;">edit_road</span></a> from any institution <a href="/docs/specification/element_categories/Institution" title="Institution"><span class="material-symbols-outlined" style="font-size: 18px;">business</span></a> recognized or
improvised. He is altogether devoid of the least qualification to the office he has
usurped and has only committed to memory a few passages from the good book for the
purpose of lending to his fraudulent sermons some faint flavor of the piety he despises.<a href="/docs/specification/element_categories/Narrative" title="Narrative"><span class="material-symbols-outlined" style="font-size: 18px;">book</span></a>
In truth, the gentleman standing here before you posing as a minister of the Lord <a href="/docs/specification/element_categories/Title" title="Title"><span class="material-symbols-outlined" style="font-size: 18px;">military_tech</span></a> is not
only totally illiterate <a href="/docs/specification/element_categories/Ability" title="Ability"><span class="material-symbols-outlined" style="font-size: 18px;">auto_fix_normal</span></a> but is also wanted by the law <a href="/docs/specification/element_categories/Law" title="Law"><span class="material-symbols-outlined" style="font-size: 18px;">gpp_bad</span></a> in the states of Tennessee, Kentucky,
Mississippi, and Arkansas.<a href="/docs/specification/element_categories/Zone" title="Zone"><span class="material-symbols-outlined" style="font-size: 18px;">architecture</span></a>*

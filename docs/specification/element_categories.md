Elements form the building blocks of OnlyWorlds. Everything that constitutes or inhabits your world should find representation between the different categories and their fields.

Establishing the correct categories, and the fields to define them, is the core challenge of the OnlyWorlds project. There is no perfect solution to work towards, only the balancing of intuitive building, breadth of supported content, and utility for simulation and games.

The two vignettes below, from Cormac McCarthy's Blood Meridian, provide a sense of how these elements can be parsed from stories. Each element category has a separate page for more detailed information and discussion.

 
### Opening

See the child.<a href="/docs/specification/element_categories/Character" title="Character"><span class="material-symbols-outlined">person_4</span></a>
He is pale and thin,<a href="/docs/specification/element_categories/Trait" title="Trait"><span class="material-symbols-outlined">flaky</span></a> he wears a thin and ragged linen shirt.<a href="/docs/specification/element_categories/Object" title="Object"><span class="material-symbols-outlined">webhook</span></a> He stokes the scullery fire.<a href="/docs/specification/element_categories/Phenomenon" title="Phenomenon"><span class="material-symbols-outlined">thunderstorm</span></a> Outside lie dark turned fields with rags of snow and darker woods beyond <a href="/docs/specification/element_categories/Location" title="Location"><span class="material-symbols-outlined">castle</span></a> that harbor yet a few last wolves.<a href="/docs/specification/element_categories/Creature" title="Creature"><span class="material-symbols-outlined">bug_report</span></a> His folk<a href="/docs/specification/element_categories/Family" title="Family"><span class="material-symbols-outlined">supervisor_account</span></a> are known for hewers of wood and drawers of water <a href="/docs/specification/element_categories/Ability" title="Ability"><span class="material-symbols-outlined">auto_fix_normal</span></a> but in truth his father <a href="/docs/specification/element_categories/Relation" title="Relation"><span class="material-symbols-outlined">link</span></a> has been a schoolmaster.<a href="/docs/specification/element_categories/Title" title="Title"><span class="material-symbols-outlined">military_tech</span></a> He lies in drink, he quotes from poets <a href="/docs/specification/element_categories/Construct" title="Construct"><span class="material-symbols-outlined">api</span></a> whose names are now lost.

He rides up <a href="/docs/specification/element_categories/Event" title="Event"><span class="material-symbols-outlined">saved_search</span></a> through the latterday republic of Fredonia <a href="/docs/specification/element_categories/Institution" title="Institution"><span class="material-symbols-outlined">business</span></a> into the town of
Nacogdoches. The Reverend Green had been playing to a full house <a href="/docs/specification/element_categories/Collective" title="Collective"><span class="material-symbols-outlined">groups_3</span></a> daily as long as the rain had
been falling and the rain had been falling for two weeks.<a href="/docs/specification/element_categories/Narrative" title="Narrative"><span class="material-symbols-outlined">book</span></a>

He stood with others of his kind <a href="/docs/specification/element_categories/Species" title="Species"><span class="material-symbols-outlined">crib</span></a> along the back wall. The only thing that might have
distinguished him in that crowd was that he was not armed. Neighbors, said the reverend, he couldnt stay out of these here hell,
hell, hellholes <a href="/docs/specification/element_categories/Language" title="Language"><span class="material-symbols-outlined">edit_road</span></a> right here in Nacogdoches.



### The Judge

 

An enormous man <a href="/docs/specification/element_categories/Character" title="Character"><span class="material-symbols-outlined">person_4</span></a> dressed in an oilcloth slicker <a href="/docs/specification/element_categories/Object" title="Object"><span class="material-symbols-outlined">webhook</span></a> had entered the tent <a href="/docs/specification/element_categories/Location" title="Location"><span class="material-symbols-outlined">castle</span></a>
and removed his hat. He was bald as a stone and he had no trace of beard and he had
no brows to his eyes nor lashes to them <a href="/docs/specification/element_categories/Trait" title="Trait"><span class="material-symbols-outlined">flaky</span></a>.

The reverend had stopped his sermon <a href="/docs/specification/element_categories/Construct" title="Construct"><span class="material-symbols-outlined">api</span></a> altogether. There was no sound in the tent.
All watched the man. He adjusted the hat and then pushed his way forward <a href="/docs/specification/element_categories/Event" title="Event"><span class="material-symbols-outlined">saved_search</span></a> as far as the
crateboard pulpit where the reverend stood and there he turned to address the
reverend's congregation.<a href="/docs/specification/element_categories/Collective" title="Collective"><span class="material-symbols-outlined">groups_3</span></a>

His face was serene and strangely childlike. His hands were small. He held them out.
Ladies and gentlemen I feel it my duty to inform you that the man <a href="/docs/specification/element_categories/Species" title="Species"><span class="material-symbols-outlined">crib</span></a> holding this revival
is an imposter. He holds no papers of divinity <a href="/docs/specification/element_categories/Language" title="Language"><span class="material-symbols-outlined">edit_road</span></a> from any institution <a href="/docs/specification/element_categories/Institution" title="Institution"><span class="material-symbols-outlined">business</span></a> recognized or
improvised. He is altogether devoid of the least qualification to the office he has
usurped and has only committed to memory a few passages from the good book for the
purpose of lending to his fraudulent sermons some faint flavor of the piety he despises.<a href="/docs/specification/element_categories/Narrative" title="Narrative"><span class="material-symbols-outlined">book</span></a>
In truth, the gentleman standing here before you posing as a minister of the Lord <a href="/docs/specification/element_categories/Title" title="Title"><span class="material-symbols-outlined">military_tech</span></a> is not
only totally illiterate <a href="/docs/specification/element_categories/Ability" title="Ability"><span class="material-symbols-outlined">auto_fix_normal</span></a> but is also wanted by the law <a href="/docs/specification/element_categories/Law" title="Law"><span class="material-symbols-outlined">gpp_bad</span></a> in the states of Tennessee, Kentucky,
Mississippi, and Arkansas.<a href="/docs/specification/element_categories/Territory" title="Territory"><span class="material-symbols-outlined">architecture</span></a>

OnlyWorlds offers a single language for the widest possible variety of worlds. See [ecosystem explorer](https://ecosystem-explorer.onlyworlds.com) for an interactive tutorial on the language supporting infrastructure (3D on desktop, 2D on mobile). 

Below: creating your first world and migrating existing content. Developers building tools or integrating OnlyWorlds into existing software can use the [developer documentation](/docs/development/).

## Create a World

 
Sign up at [onlyworlds.com](https://onlyworlds.com/accounts/signup/), go to the world section, then create a world. The world's auto-generated API key (together with the PIN from your profile) enables you to transfer the world across tools. 

Add elements using the onlyworlds.com web interface, [base tool](https://base-tool.onlyworlds.com) (general creation, online and offline, import and export), or [write tool](https://onlyworlds.github.io/write-tool/) (dedicated writing interface, graph view, element showcasing).

## Migrate Existing Content

OnlyWorlds offers a migration pipeline for converting text in any format into a compatible format.

**[OnlyWorldsBot](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-dydgDFnOz-onlyworldbot)** converts text of any format (scattered docs, exports from other tools/websites, pictures of handwriting, your favorite book) into OnlyWorlds elements. Open OnlyWorldsBot, say 'parse' to it, then paste your content. The GPT will convert it to output data in compatible JSON format. 

Copy this output into the [**base tool**](https://base-tool.onlyworlds.com)'s 'migrator' screen (double arrows icon in left bar). It will validate the output and offer bulk import of elements (note: can take a bit of time for large datasets). If issues are identified, it will give you a copy to put back into the GPT conversation to fix those issues.

## What's Next

See the [tool directory](/docs/tools/) for available tools. A tool marketplace with voting is under construction. Request new tools or features in [Discord](https://discord.gg/twCjqvVBwb) until it's released.

OnlyWorlds has been in development for 15 years and entered open alpha in October 2025. Current priority: validate and improve the language definitions through user feedback. 

Build worlds, test the tools, find edge cases and new requirements. Submit feedback via [Discord](https://discord.gg/twCjqvVBwb), [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/OnlyWorlds/OnlyWorlds/discussions/categories/schema), or the [text tool](https://onlyworlds.com/text_tool)'s feedback system.

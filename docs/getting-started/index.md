## Getting Started

## <span class="material-symbols-outlined" style="vertical-align: middle;">edit_note</span> as world builder

OnlyWorlds comes with a [free set of tools](/docs/tool-directory/) for building new worlds and converting existing work.

1. Sign up at [onlyworlds.com](https://onlyworlds.com) 
2. Note your PIN from your profile (or change it to something memorable)
3. Create a new world in the Worlds section
4. Copy the world's API key and use it with your PIN in any tool

Navigate to [My First OnlyWorld](my-first-world/) for a more detailed walkthrough and general introduction to key concepts.

The [Parsing & Migrating](parsing-and-migrating/) helps you effectively migrate existing work into OnlyWorlds.

[Translation Examples](translation-examples/) illustrate how to understand and create OnlyWorlds elements.


## <span class="material-symbols-outlined" style="vertical-align: middle;">terminal</span> as developer

OnlyWorlds provides a standardized, predictable format that integrates into new or existing software with no commercial restrictions.
 
Visit the [Developer Support](/docs/developer-support/) section for guides and AI tools to get you started. The [my first tool](/docs/developer-support/my-first-tool/) guide shows developers of any level how to develop tools, and the [template tool](https://github.com/OnlyWorlds/tool-template) provides an easy starting point to build on top of.

The [GitHub repository](https://github.com/OnlyWorlds/OnlyWorlds) has more resources and guidelines for contributing to the OnlyWorlds ecosystem.

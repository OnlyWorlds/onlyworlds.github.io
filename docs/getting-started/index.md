The representation of worlds in text-based data means that worlds are easy to store and move around: they can be exported and imported as a single (large) text string.

[Onlyworlds.com](https://www.onlyworlds.com) offers free storage and management of your worlds, and enables easy transfer using a world API system. Create an account there to get started.  Once you've created a world, take note of its API Key. Pair it with the PIN number you can find in your profile for full use of the [Tool Directory](../tool-directory/).

You can leverage AI to migrate existing work of into OnlyWorlds.  

**[OnlyWorldsBot](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-dydgDFnOz-onlyworldbot)** identifies OnlyWorlds elements and relations and shapes it into OnlyWorlds JSON. Say 'parse' to activate, then paste your content and iterate using the [**base tool**](https://base-tool.onlyworlds.com)'s validation until the JSON format is correct and complete.  
 
Local AI agents such as Claude Code can also be set up for parsing and upload systems. Contact the developer for support or collaboration.
